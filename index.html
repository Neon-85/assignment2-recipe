    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol type="a">
        <li><b>Preheat Oven:</b> <br> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease them.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Cream Butter and Sugars:</b> <br> In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Add Eggs and Vanilla:</b> <br> Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Combine Dry Ingredients:</b> <br> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:</b> <br> Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Fold in Chocolate Chips:</b> <br> Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Form Cookie Dough:</b> <br> Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Bake:</b> <br> Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown around the edges.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Cool and Enjoy:</b> <br> Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> <br> Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or as a treat any time of the day!</li>

    <li>You can add chopped nuts like walnuts or pecans for extra texture if desired.</li>
    <li>Store cookies in an airtight container to maintain freshness.</li>
